University of Pennsylvania is only a clearing house.  All specimens are in slow or fast transit for donation to to public institutional collections.  To know which is going where, contact us at djanzen@sas.upenn.edu and whallwac@sas.upenn.edu.   Primary specimen recipients are American Museum of Natural History, Monell Cryofacility (New York, N. Y.), National Museum of Natural History (Washington,D.C.), American Entomological Institute (Gainesville, Florida), McGuire Biodiversity Center (Gainesville, Florida), Canadian National Collection (Ottawa, Ontario), INBio (Santo Domingo de Heredia, Costa Rica), and others.    Specimens are either oven dried (pinned, spread, mounted) in the field in ACG in Costa Rica, or preserved in 95% ETOH and refrigerated or frozen (-20C) until later processing and deposition in an institutional collection.    Caterpillars and wild-caught adult Lepidoptera are individually voucher coded with a voucher code of the kind yy-SRNP-x to yy-SRNP-xxxxx if reared, or yy-SRNP-xxxxxx if wild-caught.  If parasites reared from a SRNP voucher, the parasite receives also its own individual voucher code of the format DHJPARxxxxxxx (though if it was a lot reared from one caterpillar, only the individuals selected from that lot for individual treatment receive the DHJPARxxxxxxx individual code.  It is hoped that the SRNP and DHJPAR acronyms will not be used by other collections to distinguish their voucher codes from others.","Biological: Other or Undefined","Storage Environment: Other (please define)","Active","","Department of Biology","University of Pennsylvania","3740 Hamilton Walk","Philadelphia","PA","19104-6018","USA","Department of Biology","University of Pennsylvania","3740 Hamilton Walk","Philadelphia","PA","19104-6018","USA","Daniel Janzen","","http://grbio.org/cool/kbdr-ke2k"

The herbarium was founded in 2002 by the current Professor of Botany at Pablo de Olavide Dr. Modesto Luce&amp;ntilde;o Garc&amp;eacute;s. This is a small pubic herbarium specialized in two angiosperm families, Cyperaceae (sedges; especially from the mega-diverse genus&amp;nbsp;Carex) and Resedaceae, coming worldwide but mainly from Europe, Iberian Peninsula and Mediterranean basin, according to the main research lines conducted in the Botany Area of the University. However, it has also a representation of a broad spectrum of angiosperms of these and many other parts of the world. Its funds currently consists of about 10,000 specimens in sheets. Its collection is being steadily increased and computerized. The sheets are previously frozen previously to its storage in an isolated room with controlled temperature and humidity and subjected to periodic pest control. In this room there is no staff working continuously in situ, which facilitates conservation and prevents possible contaminations and pest attacks. Once selected, materials of interest are studied outside the herbarium, in the laboratory or as material requested in loan. The herbarium staff currently consists of the Curator and a technician working part time.","","Sample Treatment: Dried","Active","","UPOS herbarium, Botany Area, Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemical Engineering","Pablo de Olavide University,","ctra. de Utrera km. 1","Seville","Seville","41013","Spain","","","","","","","","Santiago Martín-Bravo","","http://grbio.org/cool/3eqg-a2et"
