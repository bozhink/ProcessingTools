2.0 FILES IN THIS DELIVERY

------------------------------------------------------

2.1 Catalog Files

These files are not part of the DTD Suite proper, but 
are provided as a convenience to implementors.

catalog-v2.xml - XML catalog made according to the
                 OASIS DTD Entity Resolution XML Catalog V2.2
"http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/entity/release/1.0/catalog.dtd"


catalog.ent - OASIS SOCAT catalog of the fpi and file names.
              This is the old style OASIS catalog, similar to
              SGML catalogs.
                           
------------------------------------------------------
2.2 Modules Specific to the NLM Journal Archiving DTD

archivearticle.dtd          
             - Main DTD for NLM Journal Archiving DTD;
               this is the DOCTYPE that covers a journal
               article and various other non-article
               journal content such as book and product 
               reviews. This DTD invokes almost all the 
               modules in the NLM Archiving and Interchange
               DTD Suite.

archivecustom-modules.ent 
             - Names all new modules created specifically
               for this DTD (therefore not part of the
               base DTD Suite)
               
               This module must be called as the first 
               module in the DTD, just before the Suite 
               Module of Modules %modules.ent;, which it
               supplements.

archivecustom-classes.ent
             - The DTD-specific class definitions for the 
               this DTD. Used to over-ride the Suite
               default classes.
               
               Declared in %archivecustom-modules.ent;.
               Must be invoked before the default classes
               module.

archivecustom-mixes.ent
             - The DTD-specific mix definitions for the 
               this DTD. Used to over-ride the Suite
               default mixes.
               
               Declared in %archivecustom-modules.ent;.
               Must be invoked before the default mixes
               module.

archivecustom-models.ent
             - The DTD-specific content model definitions 
               for this DTD. Used to over-ride the Suite
               default models.
               
               Declared in %archivecustom-modules.ent;.
               Must be invoked before all of the DTD Suite
               modules since it is used to over-ride them.
            
               There are two types of such over-rides. Those 
               that replace a complete content model are
               named with a suffix "-model". Those that are 
               OR-groups of elements (intended to be mixed 
               with #PCDATA inside a particular model) are 
               named with an "-elements" suffix.

------------------------------------------------------

2.3 DTD Suite: Critical Base Modules

modules.ent      - Names all the modules in the NLM 
                   Archiving and Interchange DTD Suite
                                      
                   Must be called as the second module
                   by any DTD, after the DTD-specific module
                   of modules (if any) and before all other 
                   modules.
                   
                   NOTE: This modules may name modules (such as 
                   the OASIS-Exchange module) that are NOT used 
                   by this DTD.

common.ent       - Defines all elements, attributes, and
                   entities used by more than one module
                   
                   Called after all module-of-modules modules
                   and all customization (over-ride) modules
                   but before all the class modules. 

These modules need to be invoked before all other modules 
in a DTD. Other modules can usually be invoked in any order.
They are listed below alphabetically.

default-classes.ent       
                 - Sets up the original class definitions,
                   which are sets of elements used in
                   the same way, that are used to build all
                   OR groups in the content models of the DTDs.
                   These may be over-ridden by the DTD-
                   specific class Parameter Entities.

default-mixes .ent       
                 - Sets up the original mix definitions,
                   which are sets of classes used in
                   the same way, that are used to build some
                   OR groups in the content models of the DTDs.
                   These may be over-ridden by the DTD-
                   specific mix Parameter Entities.
