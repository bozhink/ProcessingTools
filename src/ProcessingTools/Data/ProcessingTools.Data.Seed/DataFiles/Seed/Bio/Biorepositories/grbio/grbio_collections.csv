About 25 monographs and more than 600 publications are based on this collection. The material has been collected during the past 60 years by professional entomologists and has been deposited from private collections.  	&amp;nbsp; Coleoptera. The collection of beetles consists of two main parts: a joint collection of the Institute (ca 35,000 specimens) collected largely from Estonia and a private collection of J. Mil&amp;auml;nder (1900-1992) with 33,971&amp;nbsp; specimens.  	&amp;nbsp; Lepidoptera. A significant part of the collection is formed of the personal collection of W. Petersen (1857-1933) containing both Micro- and Macrolepidoptera from various parts of the Palearctic region (about 55.000 specimens, holotypes of 6 taxa and 15 paratypes).  	&amp;nbsp; The personal collection compiled by the amateur lepidopterist R. Suurpere, (12,000 macrolepidopteran specimens) and by R. S&amp;uuml;lla (4,300 specimens) comprises exclusively Estonian material.  	&amp;nbsp; The main collection of the Estonian Macrolepidoptera comprises 200,000 mounted and labelled specimens and about 150,000 specimens of unmounted material. Traditionally the butterflies are the most closely investgated insect group. The checklist of Estonian lepidoptera comprises ca 2300 species.  	&amp;nbsp; The butterfly collection also contains unique material from insufficiently known regions of the former Soviet Union (the Russian Far East from Kamchatka to Primorye, Siberia, Central Asia, Transcaucasus, etc.) as well as material from Neotropic and Australotropic regions. The collection includes 76 holotypes, 8 lectotype and 463 paratypes.  	&amp;nbsp; Diptera. The main part of the collection (ca 140 000) is compiled by K. Elberg and it comprises material from all regions of the former Soviet Union. The&amp;nbsp; diptera collection includes 19 holotypes, 1 lectotypes, 143 paratypes and 3 allotypes.  	&amp;nbsp; Hemiptera. The material was collected by J. Vilbaste (1924 - 1985) and G. Flor (1829-1883). The collection of Homoptera (Auchenorrhyncha) by J.Vilbaste comprises the material from the Altai, Touva, Primorye, Kamtchatka and Sakhalin regions and has served as a basis for faunistic monographs (the manuscript about Sakhalin remained unpublished). A total of 173 holotypes and 2010 paratypes are preserved in this collection, most of them representing the species described by J. Vilbaste himself, a lesser fraction being obtained via exchange.  	&amp;nbsp; The systematic collection of spiders (ca 41,000 specimens), compiled by A. Vilbaste (1923-2010), and of ants (ca 80 000 specimens), compiled by V. Maavara (1928 &amp;ndash; 1999), represent all species found in the Estonian territory.  	&amp;nbsp; Smaller collection of nematodes compiled by E. Krall (1931-2009) comprises 74 type specimens.

The first curator of this Division was Fritz Haas, formerly of the Senckenberg Museum in Frankfurt, Germany. Haas (1938 - 1969) and his successor Alan Solem (1957 - 1990) built massive mollusk collections, particularly strong in unionid bivalves and terrestrial snails, reflecting their respective research interests. Current curators Rüdiger Bieler (1990 -) and Janet Voight (1990 -) focus their research and collection-building on marine molluscan groups.

The Division of Mammals contains over 250,000 catalogued specimens and is among the 5 largest in the world. Specimens date back to the 1890&amp;#39;s with the majority documenting the rapid environmental change that has occurred since 1950. The collections are taxonomically broad, representing 27 orders, 103 families, 513 genera, ~1,400 species. The majority from the Orders Rodentia (190,000), Chiroptera (25,000), Carnivora (15,000), Soricomorpha (10,000) and Artiodactyla (7,500). The collections are world-wide in scope (72 countries and all 50 US states) with particularly strong holdings from Western North America (150,000 specimens), Beringia and high latitudes (26,000 from Alaska, Russia and Canada), Mongolia (4,200 specimens and parasites), and Latin America (10,200 specimens from Bolivia 7,000 from Chile; 5,000 from Panama). The collection contains 16 holotypes, 6 paratypes, 1 syntype, 93 symbiotypes. Important collections integrated into the MSB include the USGS Biological Surveys collection (26,000), the UIMNH (Hoffmeister) Collection (33,000), Rausch Collection (4,000 specimens and parasites). Specimens range from traditional skin/skull and fluid vouchers to &amp;quot;holistic vouchers&amp;quot; containing skin, skull, post-cranial skeleton, up to seven tissue types (heart, kidney, liver, lung, spleen, muscle, blood), cell suspensions, and ecto and endo parasites. Additionally, frozen tissue samples are available for about 130,000 individual mammals and date back to the late 1970&amp;#39;s. 37,000 specimens have serology data associated with hantavirus surveillance programs in the Americas. The MSB houses an extensive archive of field journals and catalogues that date to the 1900&amp;#39;s and are associated with specimens held in the collection. The collections are growing rapidly through the active research programs of curators, staff and students and ongoing collaborations with other institutions and governmental agencies.","Biological: Other or Undefined","Storage Environment: Ambient controlled (indoors)","Institutional","Active","","Museum of Southwestern Biology","University of New Mexico","","Albuquerque","New Mexico","87131-0001","USA","302 Yale Blvd NE","CERIA 83, Room 204","","Albuquerque","New Mexico","87131-0001","USA","Gordon Jarrell","","http://grbio.org/cool/p5fp-c036"

A large part of the Illinois Natural History Fish Collection comes from specimens collected from 1880 to 1905 for S.A. Forbes and R.E. Richardson&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;The Fishes of Illinois&amp;quot; published in 1908 and from specimens collected from 1950 to 1978 for P.W. Smith&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;The Fishes of Illinois&amp;quot; published in 1979. Thousands of specimens have been added from other areas of North and South America in the past few decades. The collection contains representatives from 48 of the 50 states and many countries including: Angola, Antigua, Bolivia, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, Costa Rica, England, Guyana, Indonesia, Lebanon, Mexico, Pakistan, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Puerto Rico, Romania, Russia, Thailand, Trinidad Venezuela, and Yugoslavia. The geographic scope of the collection is about 58% from Illinois, 28% from elsewhere in North America, 13% from South America, and 1% from the rest of the world, including Antarctica.  	  	Holdings. The collection contains nearly 865,000 catalogued specimens and over 100,000 lots, which makes it about the 15th largest collection of preserved fishes, and the 6th largest collection of Neotropical fishes in North America. Represented are about 170 families and over 2,500 species. The value of the collection is greatly enhanced by the large number of old specimens, many of which were collected in the late 1800&amp;#39;s from areas where they no longer occur. The type collection contains 1220 specimens representing 93 nominal species. Name-bearing type material consists of 31 holotypes (37 species), 5 lectotypes, and 7 series of syntypes (39 specimens). Additional type material includes paratypes of 125 nominal species (1,198 specimens).  	  	We also maintain a tissue collection that contains over 1000 high quality tissues from a portion of our vouchered specimens.","Biological: Other or Undefined","Storage Environment: Ambient controlled (indoors)","Institutional","Active","","Illinois Natural History Survey","1816 S.

The first catalogue ledger of the Illinois Natural History Survey Amphibian and Reptile Collection was started in 1941.&amp;nbsp; The first 879 entries were transcribed from index cards and include specimens collected as far back as 1870.&amp;nbsp; Most of these early specimens do not include collector information.&amp;nbsp; The earliest specimen with collector information is an Eastern Massasauga collected by Stephen A. Forbes in Pekin, Illinois in 1873.&amp;nbsp; Also among these earliest records with collector data are specimens from Colorado collected by George Cooper and C.C. Crandall in 1875.&amp;nbsp; Other early collectors include F.S. Earle (specimens collected in Union Co., IL; 1877); Harrison Garman (Marshall Co., IL; 1878); H.A. Surface (Mason Co., IL; 1882) and Julius Hurter (Madison Co., IL; 1896).  	  	Holdings. The Illinois Natural History Survey Amphibian and Reptile Collection contains approximately 24,000 catalogued specimens, representing 55 families and over 550 species (51% Amphibia, 49% Reptilia). The geographical emphasis is Illinois (75%). This is the result of the efforts of Phil W. Smith, who collected specimens from 1935 to 1949 for his comprehensive study &amp;quot;The Amphibians and Reptiles of Illinois,&amp;quot; published in 1961. In addition to the Illinois material, the INHS collection also houses specimens from 45 other U.S. states, Canada, the Caribbean, Mexico, South America, Asia, Africa, and Europe. Most notable among these are specimens collected by P.W. Smith from California (1943-1952) and Mexico (1957-1965), specimens of S.A. Minton from Pakistan, Mexico and Texas and specimens from Thailand collected by R.W. Larimore (1963).  	  	Frozen Tissues.

The collection is about 95% freshwater bivalves and gastropods (mussels, fingernail clams, and snails), 1% land snails and 4% marine gastropods, almost all of which are cones. Most of the specimens were collected as a result of various faunal surveys conducted by INHS biologists from the late 1800&amp;#39;s until the present. The early collections were made by such naturalists as John Wesley Powell, Robert Kennicott, Richard E. Call, William A. Nason, Frank C. Baker, Robert E. Richardson, and Charles A. Hart.  &amp;nbsp;  The University of Illinois Museum of Natural History Collection contains over 250,000 catalogued specimens in nearly 32,000 lots, and is global in scope with significant holdings of freshwater and terrestrial species from North and Central America. The collection is about 35% freshwater bivalves and gastropods, 35% land snails and 30% marine bivalves and gastropods.  &amp;nbsp;  Together the collections have over 80,000 lots (58,000 FW, 12,000 marine &amp;amp; and 10,000 landsnails) and nearly 450,000 specimens. Over 135 countries are represented, but the collection is especially strong in freshwater mollusks from the Midwest and Southeastern United States and land snails from Southwestern United States and Central America. Over 40,000 soft parts of more than 200 species have been preserved (approximately half in ethanol) and available for study.&amp;nbsp; All specimens that can be geo-referenced have been assigned latitude and longitudinal coordinates. &amp;nbsp;","Biological: Other or Undefined","Storage Environment: Ambient controlled (indoors)","Institutional","Active","","Illinois Natural History Survey","607 E.

The representation of Minnesota&amp;#39;s flora is unparalleled, with over 170,000 specimens collected throughout Minnesota&amp;rsquo;s history by E. Nielson, O. Lakela, J.W. Moore, W.R. Smith, and many others. The assemblage of historic flora of the Upper Midwest, including the Dakotas, Wisconsin, and southwestern Ontario, is among the best in the U.S. There is an excellent collection of circumboreal and arctic flora due to past research interests of E.C. Abbe, W.S. Cooper, D. Lawrence, and their students. Additionally there is an excellent collection of historic Pacific island flora, through the efforts of J. Tilden, A.A. Heller, and J.W. Moore, as well as a collection of early Amazonian flora by H.H. Rusby and R. Squires as part of the early exploration (1895-1896) of the Orinoco River delta by the Oronoco Company Limited of Minnesota. J.W. Congdon&amp;#39;s collection (over 9,000 specimens) of early California plants (including Yosemite National Park) and approximately 3500 specimens of western US and early tropical Asian flora acquired through J.H. Sandberg&amp;#39;s exchanges are other significant collections.&amp;nbsp; This section also houses a small collection of paleobotanical specimens spanning the geologic time scale (155 macrofossils and about 75 thin sections).  The fungal collection consists of approximately 100,000 non-lichenized fungi specimens and almost 150,000 specimens of lichenized fungi.&amp;nbsp; Intensive scientific investigation of Minnesota non-lichenized fungi occurred from about 1885 to 1910, supported by the Geological and Natural History Survey of Minnesota. Collections made between 1910 and 1960 focused primarily on plant disease fungi. Renewed interest in documenting fleshy fungi began in the 1960s and has expanded in recent years with increased emphasis on the analysis of biodiversity. The following were important collectors who contributed: E.W.D. Holway (rusts of North and South America), M.E. Palm (Minnesota slime molds and fleshy fungi), M.G. Weaver, and D.J. McLaughlin and his students (Minnesota fleshy fungi). There is also an extensive collection of plant pathogenic fungi, especially the Minnesota collections of E.M. Freeman, L.T. Dosdall, and others, and rusts deposited by the U.S.D.A. Cereal Disease Laboratory (St. Paul, MN).&amp;nbsp; There are also excellent collections of lichenized fungi from the Sonoran Desert region, Minnesota, and national parks and forests (primarily by Clifford Wetmore).&amp;nbsp; The lichenized fungi also include Bruce Fink&amp;#39;s Minnesota lichens, G. Llano&amp;#39;s collections, and S.K. Harris&amp;#39; New England lichens along with a good representation of the European lichen flora.  Birds and mammals currently comprise over 45,000 birds and 20,000 mammals. In addition to Minnesota vertebrates the Museum also has important holdings of birds and mammals of the Philippines and Borneo (Menage Expedition, 1890-1893) and Mexico (Dickerman and Warner expeditions of the 1960s and 1970s), birds of Peru and Bolivia, and small mammals of the Yucatan &amp;amp; Patagonia (Birney expeditions of the 1970s and 1990s, respectively).  The fish collection currently contains over 45,000 cataloged lots, containing representatives of 142 families, 480 genera, and 1046 species, the majority of which are stored in ethyl alcohol. There is one primary and seven secondary types, including paratypes of the rare Devils Hole pupfish (Cyprinodon diabolis). The collection dates from the end of the 19th century and contains specimens collected by Ulysses Cox, Henry Nachtrieb, Thaddeus Surber, Samuel Eddy, James Underhill and others. These individuals, their students, and colleagues were responsible for building the collections from the 1890&amp;#39;s to the present. Early collections focused on fishes of the upper Midwest, especially Minnesota. However, significant historical collections include specimens from the Menage expedition to the Philippines in the 1890&amp;#39;s; specimens from Hawaii collected by E.K Jordan in the early 1900&amp;#39;s; and many specimens from the continental United States. Many of the taxa represented in these earlier collections are now rare or endangered. Samuel Eddy, James Underhill, Andrew Simons, and their colleagues and students were responsible for most of the growth of the collections since the 1950&amp;#39;s. The focus of their collections was also on Minnesota and surrounding states, although recent collecting has increased holdings of North American freshwater fishes from the southeastern highlands of the United States. Current accessions include continuing surveys in Minnesota (50%) and the eastern United States (50%). The fish collection also contains diverse holdings of marine fishes from the Pacific Northwest, Gulf of Mexico, and the Atlantic coast. In addition to the alcoholic collection there is a large collection of pharyngeal teeth from cyprinids (carps and minnows) and catostomids (suckers), a large uncataloged larval fish collection, and a growing collection of dry and cleared-and-stained skeletal material.  The reptile and amphibian collection contains approximately 19,000 specimens and focuses on the upper Midwest. This collection also contains significant collections from Mexico (Regal collections), the southeastern United States, as well as smaller collections from South Pacific islands and southwestern United States. The collection includes representative of 40 families, 152 genera, and 360 species. Among the accessioned material is an extensive series of leopard frogs collected by David Merrell in the 1960s. Merrell&amp;#39;s frogs established a baseline for studying the history of frog malformations in the Upper Midwest. The collection also contains an impressive series of cleared and stained specimens from these studies that were deposited by the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency.  &amp;nbsp;The invertebrate collection comprises 18,000 lots of mollusks, snails, and crayfish. There is also a small collection of marine specimens that was donated by the Minneapolis Public Library. Recently, the U.S. National Park Service has also begun surveying national park properties within the state and is providing the Museum with its crayfish vouchers. In addition to invertebrates, there is also a small fossil collection (approximately 1000 vertebrate fossils), mainly from Minnesota and Idaho, collected by Robert Bright (Dept. of Ecology, Evolution, and Behavior) and his students in the 1970s.","Biological: Other or Undefined","Sample Treatment: Dried","Institutional","Active","","1987 Upper Buford Circle","","","St. Paul","Minnesota","55108","USA","","","","","","","","Anita F.

Significantly, it is the largest collection of polar dinosaurs in the world with 10,000 specimens, primarily from the North Slope of Alaska. It also comprises a diverse assortment of Alaskan Quaternary mammals, including a large portion of the material collected throughout Alaska by Otto W. Geist between the late 1920s and the 1960s. The collection also contains a variety of paleobotanical specimens and a large collection of invertebrates (both micro- and macrofossils). It is home to 39 holotypes and 409 paratypes, most of which are invertebrates. The collection is growing through active research projects in different regions of Alaska and collaboration with state and federal agencies.","Biological: Other or Undefined","Storage Environment: Other (please define)","Institutional","Active","","907 Yukon Drive","","","Fairbanks","AK","99775","USA","","","","","","","","Julie Rousseau","","http://grbio.org/cool/2q8w-b5qt"

The herbarium has important collections from Norway, Iceland, the Arctic (especially Greenland, Jan Mayen, Bear Island, Svalbard, and Novaya Zemlya), Macaronesia, and East Africa (especially Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda). The material includes, e.g., the collections of Mathias Numsen Blytt (1789-1862), S&amp;oslash;ren Christian Sommerfelt (1794-1838), Niels Green Moe (1812-1892), Johannes Mus&amp;aelig;us Norman (1823-1903; part), Bernt Lynge (1884-1942), Eilif Dahl (1916-1993), and Hildur Krog (1922-).  Computerization of the herbarium labels started in September 1994, and by September 2010, all Norwegian and c. 30,000 foreign specimens are recorded. Priority is given to specimens sent out on loan, type material, and Arctic and African material. The database runs on PC&amp;#39;s under DOS, and the data are made available through GBIF-Norway to the data portal at GBIF, Artskart and NLD.  Type material may also the queried through a special service.  To facilitate registration of floristic data, the herbarium runs a field note database (NXL) and a field inventory database. These services are in Norwegian, and the databases use UTM-coordinates (MGRS notation) for localization. On these pages, you may generate registration forms for use in the field, send completed forms to the databases, and perform simple queries. The data are regularily transferred to the three portals mentioned above.  We are happy to present the bibliography databases Recent Literature on Lichens (RLL, covering the period 1951 &amp;ndash; today) and Mattick&amp;#39;s Literature Index (1532 &amp;ndash; 1950) in co-operation with its authors. The databases can be reached through a common search form.  The site also runs the web page for the International Association for Lichenologist&amp;#39;s field meeting in Yunnan, 2002, and the abstract database of the 7th International Mycological Congress, Oslo, 2002.

In the 1870s, as professor and state geologist, Eugene Allen Smith, directed students on field trips throughout the state where they collected many new specimens and met persons who also contributed to the collections.  	  	Dr. Dana Ehret is&amp;nbsp;Curator of Paleontology.  	  	The Invertebrate Paleontology Collection is estimated to contain over 20,000 lots of specimens, although only 4,000 are catalogued. Specimens are mainly from the Oligocene, Eocene, and Cretaceous deposits of Alabama. The Paleogene (Eocene plus Oligocene) deposits in Alabama are considered to be among the best in the world.  The Vertebrate Paleontology Collection consists of over 8,000 catalogued items, most of which consist of individual specimens. The collection contains items from the Pennsylvanian, Cretaceous and Paleogene deposits of Alabama, but focuses primarily on Cretaceous and Eocene marine formations.&amp;nbsp;The vertebrate collections have strong representation of Cretaceous mosasaurs, Eocene whales, and Pennsylvanian trackways from the Union Chapel Mine trackway site.

The egg and nest collection contains over 14,000 items, including over 12,800 egg sets, 220 nests, and 900 egg-nest combinations. The size of this collection ranks it as one of the largest such collections in North America. Eggs of nest parasites (e.g., cowbirds) are present in approximately 120 sets, and 150 egg sets or nests are associated with catalogued bird specimens. Eggs in this collection range in size from the tiny eggs of hummingbirds (0.2 grams) to the gigantic eggs of the extinct elephant bird (9 kilograms). Approximately 80-90% of the specimens are accompanied by original collector data slips and by photographs of sets taken in the museum, both of which are digitally linked to the record online. These data slips contain information on collecting locality, date, clutch size, incubation, identification, nest composition, and nest placement.","Biological: Preserved organisms, their parts and products","Sample Treatment: Dried","Institutional","Active","MVZ egg and nest specimens are not sent on loan.

This collection was created by Milton Hildebrand, Professor Emeritus, University of California at Davis, and a former MVZ graduate student. Hildebrand developed or perfected most of the anatomical techniques used in his specimen preparations, and many items in the collection are cross-referenced to laboratory exercises in vertebrate functional morphology that he designed. The unique and often delicate nature of these anatomical preparations makes them especially valuable for teaching, but also prohibits their availability for loans.","Biological: Preserved organisms, their parts and products","Sample Treatment: Dried","Institutional","Active","The MVZ Hildebrand collection is open to visitors by advance appointment.

Authorized faculty and students are those who need to use the collections for teaching and research. Visitors wishing to use the collection must request an appointment in advance and be approved by the curators. Visits will be granted as the curators’ schedules permit. Visitors must be supervised by the curators, authorized faculty, or students at all times. The following criteria will be used to grant access to the collection: 1. The individual must have a legitimate reason for using the collection (e.g., scholarly research), 2. The individual must comply with security precautions and collection procedures, 3. The individual must be willing to work during regular departmental hours, and 4. The individual may be asked to demonstrate competence in the physical handling of specimens. Visitors who have abused their status or damaged specimens may be denied access. Keys are not issued to non-University personnel, except in rare cases and only with permission from the curators. Non-academic requests (private collectors, hobbyists, clubs, commercial users, artists, etc.) will be reviewed individually. Such non-academic access (tours behind the scenes) will be closely supervised by the curators, authorized faculty, or students. Research and photographic equipment, and preparation materials will be made available whenever possible. Access to the Collection’s archives and specimen data is open to the public with written permission of the curators, with occasional restriction on documents containing information on site-specific location of rare, threatened, and endangered species, significant historic, archaeological, and paleontological sites if the disclosure of such information would jeopardize the integrity of continued existence of the resource.
